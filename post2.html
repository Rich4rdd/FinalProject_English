                    <h2 class="section-heading">What is a Job Interview?</h2>
                        <p>A job interview is a conversation which occurs between a potential employer and a job applicant. During the job interview, the employer has the opportunity to appraise applicant’s qualifications, appearance and general fitness for the job opening. In parallel the applicant tries to learn more about the position, to appraise the employer and to find out if your needs and interests will be met. Think of the interview as a conversation between two people where each person is trying to learn more about the other. The interview process is a two-way street. You are traveling toward a goal—the right job and the employer is traveling toward a goal—the right hire.</p>
                        <p>As a general rule, a job interview is an important part of the process of applying for a job, and it may range in formality from a casual conversation to a series of serious discussions with an assortment of people working within the company. If a job applicant manages to land a job interview, it indicates that the employer has at least some interest. Typically, an applicant responds to an advertised job opening, providing a resume and other requested materials. The employer or a representative reviews all received applications, and decides who should be invited back for an interview. In some cases, a preliminary interview may be held on the phone, to save resources and time for both parties.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the size of a company and its organization, an applicant may only have one job interview. This is common with small businesses, in which candidates are often interviewed directly by the employer. In other cases, a representative of the human resources department may interview a candidate first, and then he or she will go through a series of interviews with potential supervisors and other personnel. Larger companies may also have interview panels with multiple members who cooperate to make a decision. Coaching for job interviews can get quite extensive. As a general rule, it is a good idea to dress neatly, as though you are dressing for work. In addition, it helps to be organized and well put together. It helps to be able to answer questions about material on your resume, for example, and it is an excellent idea to put together a list of questions of your own. After a job interview, it is conventional to shake hands with the interviewers, and to follow up with a thank-you letter to keep your face fresh in the mind of your potential employer.</p>
                        <p>Interview types:</p>
                        <ul> 
                        <li>Structured : A systematic approach whereby each candidate is asked the same predetermined questions so that they can be rated with a standardised scoring system. </li>   
                        <li>Semi structured : The interviewer asks open-ended questions to encourage conversation rather than following a simple question and answer format. </li>
                        <li>Unstructured : In this type of interview the questions may be changed depending on the candidate’s responses. The direction of the interview can be casual, and these interviews are considered less formal.  </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What Are Some Examples of Questions to Ask in a Job Interview?</h2>
                        <p>The most common questions asked during a job interview include:</p>
                        <ul> 
                        <li>What professional achievement are you most proud of?</li>   
                        <li>What kind of work environment are you looking for?</li>
                        <li>What do you know about the company?</li>
                        <li>Why do you want to change jobs?</li>   
                        <li>What are your career goals for the next 5 years?</li>
                        <li>Can you tell me a bit about yourself?</li>
                        <li>What would be your desired salary?</li>   
                        <li>Can you tell me about your hobbies outside of work?</li>
                        <li>What are your main strengths?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How Does a Job Interview Work?</h2>
                        <p>There are 5 steps to a job interview:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Welcoming the candidate: The recruiter introduces themselves to the candidate and invites them to have a seat in the room where the interview will take place.</li>
                        <li>Introduction of the candidate: The recruiter asks the candidate to introduce themselves and talk about their professional background and skills.</li>
                        <li>Presentation of the company and the position to be filled: The recruiter introduces the history and culture of the company, and explains the job in greater detail.</li>
                        <li>Discussion of the candidate’s experience: The recruiter asks the candidate more specific questions to appraise their skills and knowledge.</li>
                        <li>Conclusion and wrap-up: The recruiter asks the candidate if they have any questions and brings the interview to a close.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The job interview is typically the final step in companies’ recruitment process. During this stage, managers usually conduct an interview with several candidates.</blockquote>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Importance of Job Interview</h2>
                        <p>Whenever companies want to hire new employees, they want to ensure they onboard the best talent. As a part of the recruitment process, a lot of candidates apply for a job & many are shortlisted for a discussion. The discussion between a company recruiter & the candidate is known as a job interview. Through a job interview, a recruiter can get to know the candidate better in terms of his or her personality, knowledge, skills, experiences, skills etc. Post an interview discussion, the recruiter is in a position to take a sound decision about the candidate.</p>
                        <p>You should make sure you do the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Prepare well. For example, think about your motivation for the job, your strengths and weaknesses. Research the most essential information about the company. You can then go into the interview relaxed and calm.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you dress appropriately (not “overdressed”, not “underdressed” and not too suggestive).</li>
                        <li>Be to the point, friendly, and above all, remain authentic (don’t dissimulate, be yourself).</li>
                        <li>Definitely turn off your mobile phone. There is hardly anything more disruptive than the shrill sound of a mobile phone when you are presenting yourself.</li>
                        <li>Show interest in the person across from you and don’t be too centred on yourself. Present your strengths in terms of how they will benefit the company (e.g. “You will benefit from my excellent language skills” instead of “I can speak four foreign languages”).</li>
                        <li>Listen carefully. Come across as interested. Ask questions too (for example, on points that have not yet been addressed).</li>
                        <li>Remain friendly and courteous even if you think that your interviewer is not interested in working with you.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should not:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Act like a supplicant when introducing yourself. Rather, confidently present your skills, knowledge and strengths as ways you can be a good worker for the company.</li>
                        <li>Personnel managers do not necessarily have the same tastes as you and may be bothered by loud hair colours or makeup or too much perfume. Therefore, dress “normally”.</li>
                        <li>You should neither deluge the person across from you with words, nor should you say nothing out of reverence or shyness. Do not talk too quickly. Always answer questions.</li>
                        <li>Never malign former colleagues, other companies, etc. Negative assertions are always bad. Try to find something positive in every situation.</li>
                        <li>Do not make any excessive salary demands; instead, familiarise yourself in advance about what is standard pay in the industry.</li>
                        </ul>
